# Emotion-Recognizer
This project aims to accurately detect six emotions in text using advanced techniques and is accessible for real-time use on Streamlit.

# Objective:
 A state-of-the-art emotion recognition solution is adept at identifying six distinct emotions within 
 the text with an exceptional accuracy rate of 93%. By harnessing the power of GloVe word embeddings and 
 harnessing Bidirectional LSTM networks during training, The developed ML Model deeply comprehends the sentiment 
 behind written content. Through seamless integration with Streamlit, it offers live inputs and real-time predictions 
 and is hosted on streamlit for public use.
